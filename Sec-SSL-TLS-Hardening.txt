Current crypto and cipher suites settings have vulnerabilities. These settings will need to be disabled on the systems directly.
1) need to disable SSLv2, SSLv3, and other protocols
2) need to disable RC4 ciphers, and other weak ciphers

See attached Reg files that can be imported into a GPO (copied to SYSVOL)

1) GPO: Name GPO "Sec-SSL-TLS-Hardening"
2) Import setting to GPO (Registry for crypto/cipher settings)
3) apply GPO to all server/clients.
